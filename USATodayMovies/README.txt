Gannett Coding Challenge

Notes:

This implementation uses Jackson 2.2.1 for JSON processing. Since I'm not quite fluent enough with Git to figure out how to include a reference to the Jackson jars, I've just included them in my GitHub submission.

Other than that, I don't think it requires a lot of explanation. To be honest, a fair amount of the code was generated from ADK's master-detail fragment project, but it still required a considerable amount of customization to satisfy all of the requirements.
